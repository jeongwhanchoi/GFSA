# Graph Classification

Our code is based on the codebase of [Graphormer](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer) produced by microsoft. However, since there is reproduce issue on latest version([issue#127](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer/issues/127)), we use [v1.0](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer/tree/v1.0) for ZINC dataset and [main](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer/tree/main) for PCQM4M(v2). 

## ZINC
```
cd Graph_ZINC
```

## PCQM
```
cd Graph_PCQM4M
```
